              Hey, I‚Äôm Fabian. I am located in Mannheim üìç and currently pursue
              a master's degree in Chemical Engineering. I am really passionate
              about
              <strong> web technologies</strong>,<strong> creating</strong>{' '}
              things with code, and <strong> solving</strong> problems. When I
              am not coding I like to spend my free time with:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Weighted Calisthenics üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
              <li>Slacklining üßµ</li>
              <li>Taking care of my chili plants üå∂Ô∏è</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I discovered my passion for programming during my thesis where I
              taught myself Matlab to automate a bunch of experimental data
              analysis. Since then I fell in love with learning new programming
              languages and frameworks
            </p>
            <p>
              I would love to share my journey with you and provide information
              I wish somebody wrote down when I was learning. You can expect
              posts about chemical engineering, development, and personal
              projects I am working on.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to know more about me and my journey you can subscribe
              to my newsletter or hit me up on social media!
