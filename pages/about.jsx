              Hey, I‚Äôm Fabian. I am located in Mannheim üìç and currently pursue
              a master&rsquo;s degree in Chemical Engineering üß™. I am really
              passionate about
              <strong> web technologies</strong>,
              <strong> creating things with code</strong> , and{' '}
              <strong> solving problems</strong>. When I am not coding I like to
              spend my free time with:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Weighted Calisthenics üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
              <li>Slacklining üßµ</li>
              <li>Taking care of my chili plants üå∂Ô∏è</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I discovered my passion for programming during my thesis where I
              taught myself Matlab to automate a bunch of experimental data
              analysis. Since then I fell in love with learning new programming
              languages and frameworks
            </p>
            <p>
              I would love to share my journey with you and provide information
              I wish somebody wrote down when I was learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can expect posts about <strong>chemical engineering</strong>,{' '}
              <strong>development</strong>, and{' '}
              <strong>personal projects</strong> I am working on.
