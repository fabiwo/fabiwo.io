The bigger concept behind Ternary Equilibrium is an **easy-to-use** and **easy-to-access** resource to create ternary graphs for scientists. It is made for people that want a convenient way to go from experimental/simulated data to a presentation ready graph.

Existing tools either require programming knowledge or are to difficult to achieve the task. The application therefore is built with simplicity in mind. The user simply has to provide the equilibrium points either by importing a file or by typing them out into a table. The application connects everything ready to be presented.
