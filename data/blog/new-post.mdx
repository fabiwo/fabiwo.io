The process of Website creation starts with a design and mockup where the appearance of the website is decided. The Developers then start designing the Interface, add functionalities, and make the website responsive. They then send it to another set of Developers who handle the server-side code and deploy it on the server.

**Front-end Developers:** They are responsible for the User Interface and design of the website and make it responsive for all devices.

**Back-end Developers:** They handle the server-side code and deploy the website on the server which handles the requests and response.

**Full Stack Developers**: They are developers who have both frontend and backend skills.

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
