This is the official Guide on how to use Ternary Equilibrium. For better readability the article is going to cover:

1. What is a ternary graph ? ▲
2. Who uses ternary graphs ? 📈
3. Ternary graphs in Chemical Engineering 👨‍🔬
4. Why I created the Ternary Equilibrium 🔥
5. Overview of the Application 🧐

After a quick introduction i would like to guide you step for step into how to use the application:

## What is a Ternary Graph? ▲

In general a ternary graph is a triangular diagram used to display the proportion of **three variables** (a,b,c) that
together compound to a constant. Usually the constant is either 1.0 or 100%.

<TeXBlock expression={String.raw`left+bottom+right=1`} />

The graph therefore consists of three axes:

- The <span className="font-bold text-red-500">left</span>
  axis
- The <span className="font-bold text-blue-500">bottom</span> axis
- The <span className="font-bold text-green-500">right</span> axis
