abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical approach for maximizing productivity in microreactors by a controlled extension of the tube diameter. A one-dimensional numeric model was developed where the tube diameter increases based on the reaction heat to achieve a constant temperature throughout the reactor length. Through this approach, a basic plug flow reactor model for mass and heat transfer was used with an integrated algorithm for a controlled diameter extension. A parametric study was performed to ensure safe operating conditions concerning thermal runaway. The results show an increase in productivity of approximately 42% for the fictional second-order test reaction.
