abstract: The invention relates to an apparatus for investigating reactions comprising a liquid phase and a gaseous phase in the presence of a solid catalyst (13), comprising a channel (9) in which the solid catalyst (13) is accommodated, a drop generator (7) for supplying at least one individual drop (31) into the channel (9), and an analysis unit (11) or measuring unit, characterized in that a gas connection for supplying the gas phase is further comprised and the channel (9) has a hydraulic diameter of 0.1 to 5 mm at the beginning and at the end of the solid catalyst (13), respectively, and a pump unit is comprised with which the at least one single droplet (31) can be moved through the solid catalyst (13) in an oscillating manner. The invention further relates to a method for investigating a three-phase reaction in such an apparatus.
